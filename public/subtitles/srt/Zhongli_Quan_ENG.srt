1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:04,416
Have you noticed the magnificent sculpture

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:06,083
depicting a man on horseback?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
See how he leans out from
his saddle

4
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,500
once holding something
in his hand.

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,000
A polo stick! Yes, you heard
that right.

6
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,000
Polo was already played in China

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,333
during the eighth century.

8
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,291
It was known as - jiqiu,
meaning “strike ball,”

9
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,625
and was a popular pastime
at the imperial court.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,458
Even women were allowed
to take part in the game.

11
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,625
In fact, during the Tang
dynasty, women

12
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,083
enjoyed greater freedom

13
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,458
than in many other periods
of Chinese history.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,416
Horses were highly valued

15
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,000
admired for their strength
and endurance. 

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,291
They served both in the
military and

17
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,208
in leisure pursuits such
as hunting and polo. 

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,541
But owning a horse was
not for everyone;

19
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,458
it depended on one’s rank
and status in society.

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,375
The ceramic horse you see
here was likely made

21
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,333
for the tomb of a wealthy individual.

22
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,083
It would have been placed
alongside other objects

23
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,750
that symbolized the deceased’s
status and power

24
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,458
believed to be essential
companions in the afterlife.

25
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,666
Even in my own time,
during the Han dynasty,

26
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,291
more than two thousand
years ago,

27
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,375
such traditions were already
well established.

28
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,166
But since I became an immortal,

29
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,916
it is something I never had
to worry about.

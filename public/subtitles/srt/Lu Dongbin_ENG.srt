1
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,375
Have you looked carefully
at the large

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,875
bowl in this display case?

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,333
It is beautifully painted
with gold pigment,

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,250
showing a classic Chinese
river landscape.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
You can see the
mountains and trees,

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,875
a fisherman in his boat

7
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,541
and someone crossing
a small bridge.

8
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,958
Just the kind of peaceful of setting where a scholar like me

9
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,541
would feel most at ease,

10
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,375
reciting a poem along the riverbank.

11
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,000
Long ago, in the early
years of my life,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,875
I tried to become a
government official.

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,208
But I failed miserably and
abandoned court politics

14
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,750
for a tranquil life and in time,

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,375
I became one of the
Eight Immortals. 

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,541
But let us not wander too
far from the bowl!

17
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,416
Notice how the gold
pigment shines

18
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,000
so vividly against the soft
blue background.

19
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,458
To create this speckled
blue effect,

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,875
craftsmen blew cobalt
pigment through

21
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,333
a bamboo tube covered
with gauze onto the surface

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,041
of the unglazed vessel.

23
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,333
Imagine the skill and patience
that were required!

24
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,875
It was also a costly process,

25
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,791
the bowl had to be fired
several times,

26
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,083
and gold pigment was an expensive material.

27
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,875
This type of porcelain is
characteristic of the reign

28
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:20,875
of Emperor Kangxi and was made in the early 18th century.

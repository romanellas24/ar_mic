1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:02,875
Want some tea?

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:05,125
The peach-shaped teapot in this display case

3
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,250
is just the thing for serving it.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,250
It was made during the reign

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,166
of the emperor Kangxi,
from 1662 to 1722,

6
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,166
the very same period in which I was created

7
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,125
in the city of Jingdezhen,

8
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,333
the porcelain capital of China.

9
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,500
Do you know how to fill this teapot?

10
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,625
There’s no opening on the top, quite puzzling, isn’t it?

11
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,791
To discover its secret, you must turn it upside down.

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,500
There you’ll find the opening used to pour in the tea.

13
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,416
These ingenious teapots became fashionable in China

14
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,250
from the late Ming dynasty onward,

15
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,333
around the seventeenth century. 

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,833
Now, notice its shape: the peach.

17
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,250
This fruit is one of the most auspicious

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,291
symbols in Chinese culture.

19
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,958
Legend tells that in the garden

20
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,500
of the Queen Mother
of the West,

21
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,083
a divine tree bears peaches
that grant

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,166
immortality to those
who eat them.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,458
Chinese art is filled with symbols of the

24
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,333
eternal quest for immortality.

25
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,583
Just look at the object I hold in my hand, a - ruyi scepter,

26
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,000
another emblem of longevity and good fortune.

27
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,583
And on the teapot itself,
you can see

28
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,666
yet another sign of immortality:

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,958
the crane bird,

30
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,958
who according to legend is said to live 1000 years.

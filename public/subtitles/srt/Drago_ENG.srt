00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:09,750
Look at the fantastic birds painted on the plate in the display case, with their long feathered tails,

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,125
 aren't they magnificent?

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,333
In Japanese art, they are known as ‘hoo’

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,875
often translated as phoenix.

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:23,791
This mythical bird comes from China, where it is often shown together with me - the dragon

6
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,083
symbolising the empress and the emperor.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,125
The bird was seen as a sign of good fortune and was said only to descend from heaven

8
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,750
when the empire was ruled with virtue.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,541
These beliefs later spread to Japan. 

10
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:45,000
The use of the phoenix in Japanese art dates back to the Asuka period, around the 6th to 7th century.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,333
On the dish you see here, the birds are shown among flowers and leaves from the paulownia tree

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,458
said to be the tree where the phoenix lived.

13
00:00:54,791 --> 00:01:00,041
Together, they may symbolize marital harmony, making this a fitting wedding gift.

14
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:05,541
To create this design, the artist painted the blue areas with cobalt pigment.

15
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:11,958
The piece was then glazed and fired, before adding the red, green, and purple colours.

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,166
A second firing completed the decoration.

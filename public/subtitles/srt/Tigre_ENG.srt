1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,625
Let’s talk about me!

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:07,333
I may be small, but I stand
for great strength.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,458
Tigers aren’t actually native
to Japan,

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,250
and the artist who made me
had certainly never seen one in real life.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,375
Still, tigers often appear
in Japanese art, 

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,708
usually looking rather catlike
and even friendly.

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,666
Artists were inspired by images
from China and Korea,

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:29,208
where real tigers did roam.
Traditionally, I represent

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,208
one of the four
cardinal directions:

10
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,166
the Blue Dragon of the East,
the White Tiger of the West,

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
the Red Phoenix of the South,

12
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,583
and the Black Tortoise entwined
with a Serpent of the North.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,791
You can see my companions

14
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,333
depicted on some of the
other objects nearby.

15
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,708
Together, we protect the universe
and ward off evil.

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,291
I’m made of porcelain, painted in
delicate cobalt blue.

17
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,375
Look closely, and you’ll notice
the artist even painted

18
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,291
each strand of my fur!

19
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,333
I’m a fine example of
Hirado ware,

20
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,291
a type of porcelain that became
popular in Japan

21
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,750
from the late 18th century,
known for its small,

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,750
finely detailed figures.
